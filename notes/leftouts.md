### Parameter Tuning

Parameter tuning methods include (as mentioned in the book as well):

- Add Early Stopping (No improvement in N epochs)
- LR Scheduling (/2 the LR) when no improvement in N epochs happen or after fix number of epochs
- Learning rate as function of epoch numbers

These are not implemented as they are trivial

### Data Augmentation

Improves the model perfomance by virtually expanding data and introducing variations (removing biases in data). opencv-python provides many√ü image transformations that could be used. Also, augmentation are not so difficult to implement by hand but their implementation is not directly related to neural networks so skipping them.
